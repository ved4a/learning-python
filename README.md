# Learning Python

This repository has been created in Summer '24, for me to learn and practice Python. For context, I am following the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, of which I have the 2nd Edition.

## Why?

I aim to automate tasks using Python by the end of this summer, to reduce inefficiencies and to become a better software engineer. With the amount of files present on my PC, the sooner I sort them out, the better, and I don't think I can call myself a software engineer if I don't know how to automate basic tasks. Let's hope I make it ã‹¡
